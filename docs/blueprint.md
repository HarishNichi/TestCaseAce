# **App Name**: Test Case Ace

## Core Features:

- Image to UI Test Scenario Generation: Generate UI test scenarios (English & Japanese) by uploading a screenshot of the UI and providing a written description. A tool analyzes the image and description, then produces comprehensive test scenarios covering functionality, layout, and localization.
- API Test Case Generation: Generate API test cases (English & Japanese) when provided with the API endpoint and sample payload. A tool will identify edge cases, boundary conditions, and potential failure points.
- Multi-language Support: Ability to write and display test cases in both English and Japanese.
- Downloadable Reports: Provide test scenarios, cases, and reports downloadable as Excel or CSV.
- API screen: Dedicated input field for the API url and Payload to tests against

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft purple (#A085CF) to convey trustworthiness and clarity in the process of test generation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F5) to create a clean and unobtrusive working environment.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) for CTAs, controls and important interface elements to improve interaction.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font that is clean, modern and objective, and appropriate for UI elements and textual reports
- Code font: 'Source Code Pro' for displaying payloads, API inputs, and test scripts.
- Simple, clear icons that reflect testing stages (input, generating, reporting) to visualize flow and actions.
- Subtle animations such as progress loaders during AI processing for user engagement.
